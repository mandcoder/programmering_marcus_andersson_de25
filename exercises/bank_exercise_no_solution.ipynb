    "# 🏦 Python OOP Exercise: Bank Class for Customer Account Management\n",
    "### Version: No Solution\n",
    "This exercise is inspired by w3resource.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 Objective\n",
    "Create a Python class named `Bank` to manage customer accounts.\n",
    "The class should allow customers to:\n",
    "- Open a new account\n",
    "- Deposit money\n",
    "- Withdraw money\n",
    "- Check account balance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧩 Requirements\n",
    "1. Use OOP principles (class, methods, instance attributes).\n",
    "2. Implement validation (e.g., prevent withdrawing more than available balance).\n",
    "3. Use `__str__()` or `__repr__()` for a readable representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✍️ Task\n",
    "- Create the `Bank` class and its methods.\n",
    "- Create at least two customer objects and simulate deposits and withdrawals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💡 Hint\n",
    "Start by defining `__init__()` with attributes like `account_number`, `name`, and `balance`.\n",
    "Then define methods: `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `get_balance()`.\n"
